# Huntley Weather Station (@huntley_weather on Twitter)
### By: Thomas Walsh, Kevin Criollo, and Saahil Patel
## Overview
Using a Rapberry Pi 4 and a TC74 Temperature Sensor connected via breadboard we have built a weather station for my hometown, Huntley Illinois. The program was originally made for a website but we decided not to launch it so now it is a twitter bot that posts hourly updates of the temperature in Huntley. **Follow us @huntley_weather** However, we have added the code for the website and everything required to run on a server.
## Usage
This code can be used to replicate a similar project but many materials are needed including a Raspberry Pi, a breadboard, wires, resistors, the TC74 Temperature sensor, and a Twitter account with developer privileges. The main usage of this account will be to check the weather in Huntley on Twitter.
## Some Things to Note
- This project has been retired because the hardware was sitting in a tupperware container outside my room.
